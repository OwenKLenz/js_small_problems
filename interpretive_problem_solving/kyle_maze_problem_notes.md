# Notes for Kyle

- Defining keywords in the rules
  - ie: What does it mean to move "North", "east" etc
  - What is a maze
  - What does it mean to be "dead", "finished and "lost"

- Walking through algorithm with a few test cases to verify logic
  - Catch logical errors before writing code

- Alternative algorithm layout
  - Combine "General Strategy" and "Algorithm"
    - "General Strategy" outlines the higher abstraction steps needed each of which represents a smaller problem
    -  Under each "General Strategy" subproblem, you can layout the "algorithmic" solution to that problem

- Doing some formulating logic while coding
  - Started with a solid algorithm, but never finished it
  - Strive to generate an algorithm that lets you "mindlessly" follow the step-by-step instructions to write your code

- Consider The available test cases and see if there are any other cases (derived from rules) that you should consider
  - Writing test cases (or at least considering what the provided test cases are illustrating)
  - ie: Coming up with your own "out of bounds" test case would have helped you solve that problem before you started getting unexpected results
